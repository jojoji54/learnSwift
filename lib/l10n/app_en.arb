  "booleanComparisonExplanation": "Great! You''ve successfully used boolean comparisons in Swift.\n\nExplanation:\n- `!isHot` checks if `isHot` is `false`.\n- `!isCold` checks if `isCold` is `false`.\n- Combining these conditions using `&&` determines if the environment is comfortable.\n\nThis exercise demonstrates how to use logical operators with comparisons to evaluate complex conditions.",
  "booleanExplanation": "Great! You''ve successfully combined boolean variables using logical operators.\n\nExplanation:\n- The `&&` operator checks if both conditions are true.\n- The `||` operator checks if at least one condition is true.\n\nBy using these operators, you can make decisions based on multiple conditions.",
  "booleanGuessExplanation": "Amazing! You''ve implemented a guessing game using booleans.\n\nExplanation:\n- `secretBoolean` holds a hidden value.\n- The user compares their guess to this value using the `==` operator.\n- Based on the comparison, you display the appropriate message.",
  "booleanGuessInstructions": "Welcome to the Boolean Guessing Challenge! 🧠\n\nYour task:\n1. Declare a constant `secretBoolean` with a boolean value.\n2. Declare a constant `userGuess` representing the user''s input.\n3. Compare both using the `==` operator.\n4. If the guess is correct, print `You guessed it! 🎉`. Otherwise, print `Wrong guess! Try again.`",
  "booleanLogicExplanation": "Amazing! You''ve successfully used logical operators to evaluate conditions.\n\nExplanation:\n- `isUserLoggedIn` and `hasPremiumAccess` are boolean constants.\n- You used the `&&` (AND) operator to check if both are true.\n- Based on the evaluation, you printed the corresponding message.",
  "booleanLogicInstructions": "Welcome to the Logical Operators Game! 🧠\n\nYour task:\n1. Declare two constants: `isUserLoggedIn` and `hasPremiumAccess`.\n2. Use the `&&` operator to check if both conditions are true.\n3. If true, print `Access granted to premium feature!`.\n4. Otherwise, print `Access denied. Please log in or upgrade.`",
  "booleanNegationExplanation": "Great! You''ve successfully used the boolean negation operator in Swift.\n\nExplanation:\n- The `!` operator negates a boolean value. For example, if `isSwiftFun` is `true`, `!isSwiftFun` becomes `false`.",
  "booleanShortCircuitExplanation": "Great! You''ve successfully worked with boolean short-circuit evaluation in Swift.\n\nExplanation:\n- The `||` operator evaluates to `true` if either condition is true, without evaluating the second condition if the first is true.\n- The `&&` operator evaluates to `true` only if both conditions are true.",
  "booleanWalkingExplanation": "Great! You''ve successfully used logical operators to combine boolean values in Swift.\n\nExplanation:\n- `isSunny` checks if it is sunny.\n- `hasUmbrella` checks if you have an umbrella.\n- `canGoWalking` combines these two values using the `||` operator to decide if you can go walking.\n\nExample:\n```swift\nvar isSunny = true\nvar hasUmbrella = false\nvar canGoWalking = isSunny || hasUmbrella\nprint(canGoWalking) // true\n```",
